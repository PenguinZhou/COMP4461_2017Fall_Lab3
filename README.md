## Overview


### What is _Pepper_?

[Pepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(robot)) is a humanoid robot by Aldebaran Robotics and SoftBank designed with the ability to read emotions. The [official website](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-4/family/pepper_technical/index_pep.html) provides a technical overview of Pepper and you can find out its structure as well as the other technical details from the instruction. You can also refer to an
<img src="./images/PEPPERbrochure_EN.pdf" alt="official brochure"  width="100%"> to obtain more general information. During the experiment, you can interact with Pepper through [contact and tactile sensors](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-4/family/pepper_technical/contact-sensors_pep.html).

#### Hardware

The Pepper robot is 120 cm tall, and weights in 28 kg. It can move around freely through 360 degrees. The Pepper also features [20 degrees of freedom](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/motors_pep.html), which means it can move in 20 different ways. This is because it has six motors in each arm, two in the neck, two in the hips, one for the knee, and another three for the wheels (as it has 20 motors in total). Pepper robot can move in any direction while rotating at the same time.

Pepper can express itself through [speech](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/loudspeaker_pep.html), [visual display](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/tablet_pep.html) and colorful [LEDs](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/leds_pep.html). It perceives the world through two [cameras](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/video_pep.html), four [microphones](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/microphone_pep.html) and a 3D [sensor](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/video_3D_pep.html) on his head, as well as several [touch sensors](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/contact-sensors_pep.html) on his body. To navigate safely, the Pepper robot leverages [laser sensors](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/laser_pep.html) and [sonars](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/sonar_pep.html) around the base. Pepper robot uses an embedded PC with an Intel Atom [card](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/family/pepper_technical/motherboard_pep.html).

#### Software

Pepper robot can detect sound, people, obstacles based on its perception algorithms. The OS is a modified Gentoo distribution called OpenNAO with [NAOqi OS](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/tools) on top of it. The robotics OS runs all the software from hardware control to AI decision making.

N.B.: You can also find out [more](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/pepper/find-out-more-about-pepper) about Pepper.

### What is _Choregraphe_?

[Choregraphe](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/us-en/downloads/pepper) is a multi-platform development application with graphical user interface. It allows you to create animations and behaviors on Pepper, test them on a simulated robot or directly on a real one, monitor and control Pepper, etc.

## Configuration

### How to install _Choregraphe_ 2.5.5?

By clicking into the [link](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/us-en/downloads/pepper) of Choregraphe download page, you will get a license key as:

```
654e-4564-153c-6518-2f44-7562-206e-4c60-5f47-5f45
```

First, we need to prepare all the components as mentioned above. Make sure that:
* The application connects the local network created by the Wi-Fi router.
* The Wi-Fi router connects the Internet.
* The bridge connects the Wi-Fi router, and all the blue lights are on without blinking.

Note that your application and the bridge should be in the same local network.

### How to get the bridge details?
You can acquire the detail information about the bridge through [this](https://account.meethue.com/login), like the Internal IP Address, Gateway, etc. You need this information to debug with the lights when you develop your applications.

## Development

### Flow chart

### Detailed explanation

### Live demo
We will follow the tutorials [here](https://developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started) to show how to get familiar with the programming environments with Hue.

First, we need to obtain the _Internal IP Address_ and bridge assigned _Username_. After get connected with Hue bulb(s) via your devices, we can acquire all the bulbs' state through the link:

```
http://<Internal IP Address>/api/<Username>/lights
```

The structure of the data is like (here we use only one bulb):

```json
{
	"1": {
		"state": {
			"on": true,
			"bri": 254,
			"hue": 14910,
			"sat": 144,
			"effect": "none",
			"xy": [0.4596, 0.4105],
			"ct": 370,
			"alert": "none",
			"colormode": "ct",
			"reachable": true
		},
		"swupdate": {
			"state": "transferring",
			"lastinstall": null
		},
		"type": "Extended color light",
		"name": "Hue color lamp 1",
		"modelid": "LCT007",
		"manufacturername": "Philips",
		"uniqueid": "(omit)",
		"swversion": "5.38.1.14919"
	}
}
```

Then we can try to modify the bulb's state via:

```
http://<Internal IP Address>/api/<Username>/lights/1/state
```

with ``PUT`` method.

Note that the range for ``bri`` and ``sat`` are from ``0`` to ``254``, and the range for ``hue`` is from ``0`` to ``65535``. The bulbs we used are in ``LCT007`` model and the CIE color space is in [Gamut B](https://developers.meethue.com/documentation/core-concepts#color_gets_more_complicated).

### About the framework

This framework is built upon HTML5 Boilerplate V6.0.1, Boostrap v4 and jsHue v2.1.1. After extract the content into your server (e.g. Apache), you can get the bridge _IP Address_ from `console`.

The console information will also tell you the current state. If you get `error` message then you need to press the button on the bridge, otherwise you will receive a string generated by bridge as your _Username_. Copy the _Username_ to your local JavaScript code and save it in the `user` variable.

```js
var user = bridge.user("<your username>");
```
You will take the variable as a key to communicate with Hue.

After that you can follow the [instruction of jsHue](https://github.com/blargoner/jshue) to pass your commands to the bridge through your devices.

## Tips
